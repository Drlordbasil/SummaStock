# Autonomous News Summarization and Stock Price Prediction

This Python project aims to create an autonomous program that leverages web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to gather stock-related news articles, generate concise summaries of the articles, and predict stock price movements based on the news sentiment. The program operates entirely online and retrieves all necessary data and resources from the web using tools like BeautifulSoup, Google Python libraries, and HuggingFace's small models.

## Business Plan

### Target User

The target user for this project is an investor or trader, named Maxine, who wants to stay up-to-date with the latest news and make data-driven investment decisions to maximize profit potential.

### Problem

Keeping track of news articles related to stocks and analyzing their impact on stock prices can be time-consuming and overwhelming. Manual reading and analysis of news articles is not only labor-intensive but also prone to human biases and errors. Additionally, it can be challenging to predict stock price movements accurately based on news sentiment alone.

### Solution

The Autonomous News Summarization and Stock Price Prediction program automates the process of gathering, summarizing, and analyzing news articles related to stocks. By leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning models, the program generates concise summaries and sentiment scores for news articles, making it easier to assess the potential impact on stock prices. The program also uses historical stock market data and machine learning algorithms to make predictions on future stock price movements.

### Market Opportunity

The financial services industry is increasingly relying on data-driven insights and automation to make investment decisions. With the widespread availability of news articles related to stocks and the growing interest in algorithmic trading, there is a significant market opportunity for an autonomous program that can efficiently gather, summarize, and analyze news articles to predict stock price movements.

### Revenue Streams

Potential revenue streams for this project include:

1. Subscription Model: The program can be offered as a monthly or annual subscription service, where users pay a fee to access and use the autonomous news summarization and stock price prediction features.

2. Data Licensing: The program can partner with financial data providers to license and sell aggregated news sentiment data to institutional investors and financial institutions.

3. API Access: The program can provide an API that allows third-party developers to access the summarized news articles, sentiment scores, and stock price predictions for integration into their own applications or trading algorithms.

### Competitor Analysis

While there are existing solutions for news summarization and stock price prediction, none offer the same level of autonomy and integration as this project. Most news summarization tools focus on generic topics and lack sentiment analysis capabilities specific to stocks. Stock price prediction models often require manual data preprocessing and lack the automation and real-time capabilities that this project aims to provide.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Autonomous News Summarization and Stock Price Prediction program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/autonomous-news-summary.git
$ cd autonomous-news-summary
```

2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the necessary API keys and configurations required for web scraping and stock market data retrieval. Refer to the documentation provided by the respective APIs for more information.

4. Update the `source_url` in the `NewsScraper` class to specify the webpages to scrape for financial news articles.

5. Implement the logic for preprocessing text and data in the respective classes (`NewsSummarizer`, `SentimentAnalysis`, `StockPricePredictor`).

6. Train the predictive model using historical stock market data and news sentiment scores. Replace the placeholder logic in the `StockPricePredictor` class with the appropriate machine learning algorithm.

7. Customize the `PredictionAlerts` class to send notifications via email, SMS, or messaging app APIs. Replace the placeholder logic with the desired implementation.

8. Customize the `PerformanceMonitor` class to calculate the accuracy of predictions based on actual stock market data. Replace the placeholder logic with the appropriate accuracy calculation method.

9. Customize the `PortfolioManager` class to provide insights and recommend adjustments to the portfolio based on stock price predictions. Replace the placeholder logic with the desired implementation.

10. Run the program and observe the generated alerts, performance metrics, and portfolio recommendations.

```
$ python main.py
```

## Conclusion

The Autonomous News Summarization and Stock Price Prediction program empowers investors and traders like Maxine to make data-driven investment decisions based on news sentiment analysis and stock price predictions. By automating the gathering, summarization, and analysis of news articles, the program saves time and provides valuable insights for maximizing profit potential.

As the financial services industry continues to evolve, the need for innovative solutions that leverage automation, NLP, and machine learning will grow. This project provides a scalable and adaptable platform for autonomous news summarization and stock price prediction, delivering tangible value to investors and traders.
